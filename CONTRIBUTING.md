## Line Endings

Text files in our project use `\n` line endings and, if you are on Windows, many editors add `\r\n` to every line. Configure git to [convert newlines](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings) or use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to ensure that your pull-request makes it through.
